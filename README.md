# AvocadoBot
This is a Discord bot based on the [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord) library.
I'm going to focus on making a new Discord bot that uses a different command framework and has better implementations of the ideas I want. Therefore, don't expect many commits after this one.

Note: This bot is ***NOT*** bug free. Use at your own risk. 
Feel free to copy & paste from this, although I don't think it'll do you any good.
